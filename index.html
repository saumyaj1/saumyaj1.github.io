    <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my page! My name is Saumya Jain and I am a junior Electrical/Computer Engineering (ECE) major at the University of Texas at Austin. I am interested in software development and am looking for internships to provide me with more experience. As much as I love school, I also love exploring new things and trying new experiences. Here is a photo of me skydiving! </p>
